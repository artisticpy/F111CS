Functions-Recursion

1. Write a C program using function that takes a character indicating a color as
an input argument and displays the full color if it is present else prints the
message that the color is not present. Here function doesn&#39;t return anything.
Rainbow colors:
R O Y G B I V = Red Orange Yellow Green Blue Indigo Violet.

2. Write a program that’s passes an integer number to a user defined function.
The function prints all the factors of that number.

3. Write a program that passes a number from main to a function. Function
checks if it’s a magic number or no and prints an appropriate message
Magic no
145 =1!+4!+5!= 145

4. Write a function to print no of digits in a number using recursion. Eg
123=3digits
