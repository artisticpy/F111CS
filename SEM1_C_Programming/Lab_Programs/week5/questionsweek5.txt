Q2. Write a program to enter marks of N students in M subjects and calculate
average and print it using nested loop
Eg. Enter No of students :5 // value of N
Enter No of subjects :3 // value of M
Outer Loop i will run from 1 to 5 (No of students)
Inner Loop j will run from 1 to 3 (No of subjects)

For 1st student Enter marks in 3 subjects: 50 80 90
Percentage: 73.3
..
For 5th student Enter marks in 3 subjects: 60 50 80
Percentage: 63.3
