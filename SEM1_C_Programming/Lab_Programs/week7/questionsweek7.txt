Q1. Write a program to store the total salary of N employees in an array. For each
employee calculate the total salary.


Total salary = Basic salary + HRA allowance + Special allowance
HRA allowance =40% of basic salary
Special allowance = 25% of basic salary.
The program then sorts the array in descending order. (highest salary to lowest salary)
Eg. Enter No of employees :3 // value of N
Enter basic salary for 1 st employee: 1000
HRA allowance (calculated)= 400
Special allowance (calculated) =250
Total salary (calculated) = 1650

Enter basic salary for 2 nd employee: 2000
HRA allowance (calculated)= 800
Special allowance (calculated) =500
Total salary (calculated) = 3300


Enter basic salary for 3 rd employee: 500
HRA allowance (calculated)= 200
Special allowance (calculated) =125
Total salary (calculated) = 825

And the sorts an array in descending order of total salary and prints the array elements.

0     1   2
3300 1650 325

Q.2 Write a C program C Program to Find the Sum of each Row &amp; each Column of a MxN
Matrix
Eg. Row/M=3, Coulmn/N= 4
1 2 0 3
0 -1 3 4
2 0 -1 -2
Sum of row 1: 1+2+0+3 =6
Sum of row 2: 0+ -1+ 3+ 4 =6
Sum of row 3: 2+ 0+-1+ -2=-1
Sum of column 1: 1+0 +2 =3
Sum of column 2:2+ -1+ 0=1
Sum of column 3:0+3+-1=2
Sum of column 4:3+4+-2=5


Q.3 C Program to check the matrix is square else print invalid. If itâ€™s a square matrix print
the Sum of the Main &amp; Opposite Diagonal Elements of a MxM Matrix.
Eg. Row/M=3, Coulmn/N= 3 (Square Matrix only)
1 2 0
0 -1 3
2 0 -1

3

Sum of main diagonal : 1 +-1+-1=-1
Sum of opposite diagonal : 0+-1+2=1



Q.4 Perform linear search in a MxN matrix, print all the occurrences of the key elements.
Eg. Row/M=3, Coulmn/N= 4
1 2 0 3
0 -1 3 4
2 0 -1 -2
Element to be searched: -1
Element is present at : [1][1] , [2][2] locations
